## Considerations and potential disadvantages for Using `cursor: pointer;` - Consistency, Design, and Device Compatibility

While the `cursor: pointer;` CSS rule can be a useful tool for improving the usability of a website, it also has some potential disadvantages and inappropriateness to be aware of.

One potential disadvantage is that it can create confusion if not used consistently. If the cursor is set to a pointer on some elements but not others, users may not be sure which elements are clickable and which are not, which can lead to confusion and frustration.

Another potential disadvantage is that it can create an overly busy design if overused. If the cursor is set to a pointer on too many elements, the website may appear cluttered and overwhelming, which can negatively impact the user experience.

Additionally, the `cursor: pointer;` rule may not be appropriate for all types of devices.

It's also not appropriate to use the `cursor: pointer;` rule on elements that are not clickable, like text or images, as it can create confusion for users and it's not necessary.

In summary, while the `cursor: pointer;` CSS rule can be a useful tool for improving the usability of a website, it's important to be aware of its potential disadvantages and inappropriateness and use it with caution and consistency.

## HTML Elements that can benefit from `cursor: pointer;` - Clickable but without pointer cursor by default

There are many HTML elements that are clickable but don't have a pointer cursor by default or could have but not on all browser.

These elements do not have a pointer cursor by default because the default cursor styles are defined in the browser's stylesheet, and the default cursor style is set to 'auto', which means that the browser will determine the cursor style based on the element's role and state.

Some elements such as `a`, `button`, `input[type="submit"]` are clickable, and the browser assigns the pointer cursor to them by default.

However, other elements such as `option`, `summary`, `menuitem` are not assigned a pointer cursor by default but could benefit from it to indicate that the element is clickable.

Such as:

- **`a`:** Anchor elements are used to create hyperlinks to other web pages or sections of a webpage.
- **`button`:** The button element is used to create a button that the user can click on.
- **`input[type="submit"]`:** Input elements with the type attribute set to "submit" are used to create buttons that the user can click on to submit forms.
- **`label`:** The label element is used to associate a label with a form control.
- **`option`:** The option element is used within a select element to create a list of options for the user to choose from.
- **`summary`:** The summary element is used within a `details` element to provide a summary or label for the contents of the `details` element.
- **`menuitem`:** The menuitem element is used to create a command that the user can invoke from a context menu.

## Conclusion

The cursor: pointer; CSS rule is a powerful tool for improving the usability of a website.

By setting the cursor to a pointer when the mouse pointer is over a clickable element, users can quickly and easily identify which elements are clickable and understand what will happen when they interact with it.

However, it's important to use the rule with caution, consistency, and attention to the design and user experience of the website, as well as the device compatibility.
