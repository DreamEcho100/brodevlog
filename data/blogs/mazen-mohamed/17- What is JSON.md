## What is JSON?

JSON stands for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation.

JSON is an open standard lightweight file format and data interchange format for storing and transporting data.

JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.

JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand.

## JSON Syntax Rules

- Data is in name/value pairs.
- Data is separated by commas.
- Curly braces hold objects.
- Square brackets hold arrays.
- Arrays called JSON Arrays.
- JSON Arrays hold JSON objects.
- JSON objects can contain another JSON objects and this is called **N**ested **J**SON **O**bjects.

## JavaScript and JSON

JSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from JavaScript _(as in it is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects)_, So a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects, and many modern programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. JSON filenames use the extension `.json`.

## Advantages and why it is preferably used

- Simple to build and debug.
- Low light-weight payload size.
- Acceptable across all modern high-level programming languages.
