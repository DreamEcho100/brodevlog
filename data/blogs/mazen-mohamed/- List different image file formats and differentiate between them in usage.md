## What Are the Different Image File Types

Image file types and formats are divided into two main different categories: **raster image files** and **vector image files**.

### Raster image file formats

Most of the photographs or the images you see on the internet with different formats on the web like:

- JPEG and JPG - (Joint Photographic Experts Group).

- GIF (Graphics Interchange Format).

- PNG (Portable Network Graphics).

Are all under the raster category.

**Since they are static**, you cannot efficiently resize the images, the original design and pixels will simply get stretched to fill the extra space. This ends up creating a blurry, pixilated, or otherwise distorted image.

Raster image file types display static images where every pixel has a defined color, position, and proportion based on their resolution (for example 1280×720).

### Vector image file formats

Unlike the static raster image file formats, where each design shape and color is tied to a pixel, these formats are more flexible, **since they are using a system of lines and curves on a cartesian plane, scaled in comparison to the total area, not any single pixel**.

Which means you can endlessly enlarge the original image resolution without any loss in quality or distortion.

Since the SVG calculates the positions based on a percentage of the total area, and not pixels, there's no pixelation at all.

Examples of vector image file types:

- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).

- EPS (Encapsulated Postscript).

- AI (Adobe Illustrator Artwork).

- PDF (Portable Document Format).

## Most Popular Image File Types (Raster image file formats)

### JPEG and JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)

JPEG (or JPG) is a raster image file format with **lossy compression** that makes it suitable for sharing images. JPEGs are "lossy" meaning they reduce file size, but also the quality of the images when you use the format.

JPEG is still one of **the most used image file types** that you'll see on the internet because of its compression and virtually universal since:

- Supported since version 1.0 of all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

- Supported by default by all image viewers and editors of all major operating systems.

Most social media platforms (like Facebook and Instagram) automatically turn uploaded image files into JPEGs. They also use unique social media image sizes to control the resolution of your photos

It is a good choice for blog and article images, like interviewee headshots, product images, and more.

**Note**: Do not use JPEG for infographics with a lot of small text or tutorial screenshots where the text is key.

### PNG (Portable Network Graphics)

PNG is a raster graphics format that **supports** lossless compression, **maintaining** detail and contrast between colors.

It offers much **better text readability** than JPEG, which makes it a more popular choice for infographics, banners, screenshots, and other graphics that include both images and text.

But as a downside it leads to a larger file sizes which can slow down your website if overused (especially high-resolution images).

And it has a good browser and OS support since:

- It is supported by all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari).

- It is supported by all major operating systems and their standard image editors.

**Note**: Do not use for high-resolution photos, as it will create large files of up to several megabytes.

### GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)

The GIF is another raster image file format type.

It uses **lossless compression** but **"constrains"** the image to 8 bits per pixel and a **limited** palette of 256 colors.

The GIF format is mostly famous and mostly used for animated images because its 8-bit limitation keeps file sizes of animations small and internet-friendly.

And it has a good browser and OS support since:

It is supported by all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari).

It is supported by all major operating systems and their standard image editors.

**Note**:

It is better to not use the animated GIFs to "spice up content" but demonstrate how to complete tasks in tutorials and guides (or showing memes :)).

Because eEven though supports animation, it's 8-bit limitation leads to limited image quality, So do not use it if you need greater than 8-bit color images (JPEG supports up to 24-bit).

### WebP

WebP is a raster image format developed specifically to provide better lossless and lossy compression of images.

Switching from JPEG and PNG to WebP can help save server disk space and significant bandwidth, with up to 35% smaller image files for identical quality.

Not supported by all browsers, image editors and OS:

- Google Chrome (Version 17+ for desktop, 25+ for mobile), Firefox (65+), Edge (18+), and Opera (11.0+), support WebP natively. Safari's planned version 14 will support WebP.

- The format is still not supported by most native OS image editors, but professional options like Photoshop supports WebP.

### TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)

TIFF is a raster image format most commonly used for storing and editing images that will be later used for **print**.

While it does **support lossy compression**, it's typically used as a lossless image format. Furthermore, most professional graphics applications that support TIFF (Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.) do not use compression. Thus, it's common for TIFF images to be large in file size.

Since it's high-quality it leads to a large file size due to typical use with no compression, Even though it's perfect for storing and preparing images and graphics for publication, and also used by many scanners to preserve the quality of scanned documents or pictures.

It has a limited browser support:

- No major browsers can render a TIFF file without add-ons or extensions.

- Mainly available as an export format for professional image editing and publishing tools.

### BMP (Bitmap)

Bitmap (BMP) is a mostly outdated image file format that **maps individual pixels with little to no compression**. That means BMP files can easily become extremely large and are impractical to store or handle without noticeable quality gains over formats like WebP, GIF, or PNG.

**It has a food browsers and OS Support**:

- Supported by all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari).

- Native support in most default OS image editors, like MS Paint.

**Note**:

- In 2022, there are basically zero legitimate use cases for the BMP image format.

### HEIF (High Efficiency Image File Format)

It's a raster image format, based on pixel mapping, meaning you cannot scale up the images without losing quality.

Even so it is great quality to file size ratio.

It is an image format developed by the team behind the MPEG video format to be a direct competitor to JPEG.

In theory, the compression is almost twice as efficient as JPEG, leading to images of up to double quality with identical file sizes.

It is used by some newer phones and devices to store photos in higher quality than JPEG files.

**No browser and limited OS support**:

- Not supported by any major browsers.

Native support in macOS Sierra and iOS 11 and later, but not in their respective Safari versions.

## Most Popular Image File Types (Vector image file formats)

### 8. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

The Scalable Vector Graphics file format, usually referred to as SVG, was developed by W3C as a markup language to render two-dimensional images right within the browser.

**It doesn't rely on pixels** like a raster format, but rather _uses XML text to outline shapes and lines in a similar way to how mathematical equations create graphs_.

This means you can scale up SVG images infinitely (_loss-free scaling_) without any loss of quality, it has a small file sizes usually used simple illustrations, shapes, and text.

Which means that SVG is the ideal format for logos, icons, simple illustrations, and anything else you want to be freely scalable with your responsive design.

Even so it is not an ideal format for images or complex drawings.

**It has a good browsers and OS support**:

- It is Supported by all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari).

- Default image editors tend not to support SVG (as it's not suitable for photographs), but most illustration software support SVG exports.

Like SVG files, EPS is actually a text-based document that outlines shapes and lines with code, rather than mapping pixels and colors. As a result, EPS files also support lossless scaling.

Advantages and Disadvantages
Lossless scaling.
Printer support for documents and designs.
Browsers and OS Support
EPS isn't a standard web image file format and isn't supported by any major browsers.
Use Cases
It's mostly used for storing, saving, and printing illustrations when working with Adobe Illustrator or other software.
10. PDF — Portable Document Format
adobe pdf
PDF file example
You probably associate PDF with storing, saving, and reading mostly-text based documents. That's perfectly understandable — document is right there in the name after all.

But PDF files are actually based on the same PostScript language that powers EPS vector image files and can be used to save images and illustrations as well.

It's the image format of choice for storing illustrations, magazine covers, and more for later printing. It's also the preferred choice for our Kinsta ebooks.

Advantages and Disadvantages
Indexable and searchable text makes it perfect for in-depth infographics or reports.
Can include links, CTA buttons, and other interactive elements.
Lossless scalability.
Cannot be included in web content, must be loaded and read as a separate file.
Browsers and OS Support
Supported by all major browsers, but you are forced to open the PDF as a separate file. (You cannot use PDF files to display images throughout your HTML content.)
Supported as a format by most standard document editors (like MS Word or Google Docs), and illustration software (AI, Inkscape) but not by image editing software.
Use Cases
PDF is the best option if you want to create an interactive visual report or infographic that complements your content. Here's a nice list of the best PDF viewer plugins for WordPress users.
11. PSD — Photoshop Document
Image file types: psd logo
PSD logo
As the name suggests, the PSD file format is an image format used for saving image documents and works in progress with Adobe Photoshop.

It's not a web-safe image format, so it's not supported by any browsers or standard image viewers or editors.

Advantages and Disadvantages
All filters, transparency, paths, and edits are fully customizable and reversible.
Lossless image quality.
Large file sizes.
Use Cases
Saving and storing Photoshop projects before and after they're completed.
12. AI — Adobe Illustrator Artwork

Like PSD, it's not meant for use on the web and isn't supported by any browsers, nor most default image viewers.

Unlike PSD files, you can freely scale AI files without any loss in quality.

Advantages and Disadvantages
All strokes, lines, shapes, filters, are customizable and reversible.
Scale up or down illustration sizes freely.
Large file sizes.
Use Cases
Saving and storing Adobe Illustrator projects before and after they're completed.
13. XCF — eXperimental Computing Facility

XCF, which stands for eXperimental Computing Facility, is an image file type native to the open source image editor GIMP. It's the equivalent of PSD files and saves paths, transparency, filters, and more.

Once again, this is a native file type for storing projects and it's not supported by any browsers or default image viewers.

Advantages and Disadvantages
All paths, filters, and shapes are customizable and reversible.
Lossless image quality.
Large file sizes.
Use Cases
Saving and storing GIMP projects before and after they're completed.
14.  INDD — Adobe InDesign Document

Adobe InDesign icon
The INDD is a native file type for Adobe InDesign users where you can save project files including page content, styles, swatches, and more.

Although sometimes referred to as an image file format, it tends to link to visual elements beyond text.

It isn't supported by any browsers or default image viewers, as it's not a web-safe format.

Advantages and Disadvantages
Store large, multi-page design projects with customizable elements.
Use Cases
It's mainly used by graphic designers and production artists for designing and collaborating on posters, flyers, magazines, pamphlets, and more.
15. Raw Image File Types
Raw image formats are the file types a digital camera uses to store full-quality images for later post-production and editing.

Major raw image file types by camera maker:

Kodak: CR, K25, KDC
Canon: CRW CR2 CR3
Epson: ERF
Nikon: NEF NRW
Olympus: ORF
Pentax: PEF
Panasonic: RW2
Sony: ARW, SRF, SR2
Rather than the 256 shades per color channel (8 bit) available in a JPEG file, RAW files offer up to 16,384 shades per color channel (14 bit) in a single picture. That gives you more flexibility when tweaking colors and contrast in post-processing.

Raw images aren't meant for the web or sharing and aren't supported by any major browser or image viewer.

Advantages and Disadvantages
Higher quality pictures with more variability in colors.
Giant image files (a raw file can easily be up to 20 to 40 megabytes).
Use Cases
Saving photos in the highest possible quality for post-processing and editing.
